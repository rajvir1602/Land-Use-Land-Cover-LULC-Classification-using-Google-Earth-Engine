# Land-Use-Land-Cover-LULC-Classification-using-Google-Earth-Engine


Built a geospatial machine learning pipeline in Google Earth Engine to classify Built-Up vs Non Built-Up regions for Delhi (NCT) using Landsat 7 TOA composite imagery (2014).

Processed multispectral satellite imagery and engineered spectral indices including NDVI and NDBI to improve class separability.

Sampled and labeled 30m × 30m pixel regions using polygon-based ground truth data.

Trained and benchmarked CART (Decision Tree), Random Forest (10–100 trees), and Linear SVM models.

Evaluated performance using 10-fold cross-validation, achieving ~65–66% average test accuracy.

Generated classification maps for qualitative spatial validation.

Tech Stack: Google Earth Engine, Remote Sensing, Python/JavaScript (GEE), Machine Learning
